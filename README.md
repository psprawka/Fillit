## Fillit - tetris that you've never played before ðŸŽ²

The goal of this project is to make the smallest possible square with a given list of tetriminos. There may be the holes in the solution, as long as it is the first possible solution when placing them from the top left.
</br></br>


### How to run fillit?
Fillit takes only one parameter - file (which has to be written in a very specific format) with the bricks to assemble. Each tetromino is represent by 4x4 block and they consist of 4 `#` pieces.
```
